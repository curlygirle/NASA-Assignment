              Home: for this page I used a Spline 3D creation I created myself,
              as I wanted the website to link towards the idea of asteroids, I
              incorporated something minimal and that looks like asteroids
            </p>
            <p>
              About: For this page as seen in the wireframes I wanted to add
              more of my asteroid elements here, however it clashed with the
              text I intended to display about my site, so I decided to not go
              with it while trying to figure out a way to move around it so that
              it may be incorporated into the next deployment version of my
              site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data-art: This page is left blank for a reason – rubric requires
              it to be blank.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data-visual: This page is left blank for a reason – rubric
              requires it to be blank.
            </p>
            <p>
              Blog: For the blogs section I made a normal page section wherein
              you can select which blog you would like to go into, and within it
              are two sections that open up and display the blogs in full and on
              their own instead of having all of them displayed on one page
              which forces the reader to go through them all instead of picking
              which one they would like to see.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design: this page was kept simple, just displaying my wireframes
              and text such as this for the user viewing to understand my reason
              for design choices.

            <p>
              Aestheticand Layout: For this I wanted to keep it very minimal and
              simple. I did not want to do too much as that can overpower the
              website and make it much difficult for the viewer to engage along
              with feeling drawn to the website.
            </p>

            <p>
              Font: The font I use throughout my entire website was ‘Lara’ font.
              I love how minimal it is, however, I am open to expanding on it by
              using other fonts for other headings, but only if I find one that
              is visually appealing to my website and me.
            </p>

            <p>
              Colour Scheme: As seen from most of the information along with
              digital art interactions displayed the colour scheme for this is
              shades of grey. The reason as to why I used shades of grey is to
              represent the asteroids and their colour, another reason being, I
              want my data visualisations and art to match the colour scheme of
              my website, however I need to first structure my data out and
              figure the colour scheme I intend to use there before I decide on
              one.

        <h3>data visualisation</h3>
        <p>
          In the digital age, data visualisation has emerged as a useful tool,
          transforming raw and complex data into aesthetically appealing
          information. In this critical reflection, we will be analysing the
          reading by Li, titled ‘Overview of Data Visualisation’ through which
          the author presents a comprehensive overview of data visualization,
          highlighting its significance, techniques, and applications in today's
          data-driven world whilst providing our own interpretation as to what
          we feel about the reading and how it relates to us. <br />
          <br />
          Before diving into the critical reflection of this reading let us
          start by defining what the term ‘data’ means. Data is seen to be a
          collection of information that is obtained by observations,
          measurements, study, or analysis. (What is Data? Classification of
          Data - Qualitative and Quantitative, no date) The data processed is
          not recognised to have any sort of meaning that affiliates with it,
          hence where data visualisation comes in. ‘Data visualisation’ is the
          graphical representation of information and data. (What Is Data
          Visualization? Definition & Examples | Tableau, no date) This form of
          representation can be seen to be portrayed in visual elements such as
          charts, graphs, infographics, maps, etc.<br />
          <br />
          Furthermore, when looking at the various forms of representation of
          data visualisation, Li mentions that it is important to take note of
          them for each one of them are seen to present different visual
          effects, which in turn emphasises the importance when it comes to
          selecting the appropriate visualisation technique based on the kind of
          data and message one intends to bring across to the audience. (Li,
          2020) Data visualisation is thereafter categorised into two common
          forms that is information visualisation and scientific visualisation.
          Information visualisation focuses on how abstract data can be
          represented in a visual way, wherein users are able to understand the
          meaning of what is being portrayed which can be seen in the formats
          known as tables, charts, graphs, etc. Whereas scientific visualisation
          is the graphic depiction of data as a technique of gaining knowledge
          and insight into scientific data, that takes the form of volume,
          waveforms, and simulations. (Li, 2020) From this above displayed
          information it has shown me the different kind of data visualisation
          that is found, along with in what formats they can be conducted in so
          that when I do further research, I am able to know what to do along
          with what to expect.<br />
          <br />
          Derieved from these two common forms we find the characteristics. When
          analysing the characteristic of data visualisation, Li breaks them up
          into three key terms such as readability which refers to the quality
          of it being legible, recognisability is the ability to recognise the
          data from previous knowledge forms and meaning being what is meant by
          the visual form portrayed. It is important to note that there may be
          more characteristics than the ones mentioned here, but these three are
          essential when it comes to data visualisation.<br />
          <br />
          Integrating data visualisation is important as it establishes value
          for the audience, this can be seen in the following ways: It makes the
          data easier to understand.Allows people who analyses data to discover
          trends within data, this can be over a period depending on the type of
          data needing to be collected. Thereafter helping you compile your
          information into one. The images displayed allows the viewers to
          memorise the information more. (Data Visualization in 2022 | The
          Ultimate Guide, 2022) Thereafter it can be used to, plan schedules,
          pinpoint relationships between data, help recognise trends and what
          outcomes can be predicted and lastly allows you to assess a
          situation.<br />
          <br />
          Data visualization serves as a link between the data and the human
          mind, allowing us to see patterns, trends, and anomalies that might
          otherwise go unnoticed if we look at them in the form of raw data.
          Representing this data visually it allows the viewer to understand and
          process the information received much easier, as someone would not
          read a list of facts maybe a few, however when presented visually,
          they will engage with it more as it is simplified along with being
          visually appealing to the human eye. Therefore emphasising that the
          way in which we portray data matters. Now looking at how this relates
          to the work we do, as web developers we try to ensure that our
          websites are easy to understand and easy to navigate through,
          therefore turning complex data into something simple to understand is
          one of the key important parts of web development.<br />
          <br />
          To conclude the discussion on data visualisation, it is clear to see
          the important role it plays in making complex data understandable.
          This article emphasises how important it is to make sure when
          portraying data that you select an appropriate method/visualisation
          technique linking to how as a web developer that such techniques are
          utilised. As we continue to navigate the big data era, data
          visualization is an essential tool for converting raw data into
          relevant insights. Furthermore it has shown me that to establish the
          best outcome from this, you need to know your audience, choose the
          right form of visualisation to display your information whilst making
          sure it is accessible.

      <h1>wireframes explaination:</h1>
        <p>Home: for this page I used a Spline 3D creation I created myself, as I wanted the website to link towards the idea of asteroids, I incorporated something minimal and that looks like asteroids </p>
        <br>
        <p>About: For this page as seen in the wireframes I wanted to add more of my asteroid elements here, however it clashed with the text I intended to display about my site, so I decided to not go with it while trying to figure out a way to move around it so that it may be incorporated into the next deployment version of my site. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Data-art: This page is left blank for a reason – rubric requires it to be blank. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Data-visual: This page is left blank for a reason – rubric requires it to be blank.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Blog: For the blogs section I made a normal page section wherein you can select which blog you would like to go into, and within it are two sections that open up and display the blogs in full and on their own instead of having all of them displayed on one page which forces the reader to go through them all instead of picking which one they would like to see.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>Design: this page was kept simple, just displaying my wireframes and text such as this for the user viewing to understand my reason for design choices.</p>
     <h1>style guide:</h1>
        <p>Aestheticand Layout: For this I wanted to keep it very minimal and simple. I did not want to do too much as that can overpower the website and make it much difficult for the viewer to engage along with feeling drawn to the website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Font: The font I use throughout my entire website was ‘Lara’ font. I love how minimal it is, however, I am open to expanding on it by using other fonts for other headings, but only if I find one that is visually appealing to my website and me. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Colour Scheme: As seen from most of the information along with digital art interactions displayed the colour scheme for this is shades of grey. The reason as to why I used shades of grey is to represent the asteroids and their colour, another reason being, I want my data visualisations and art to match the colour scheme of my website, however I need to first structure my data out and figure the colour scheme I intend to use there before I decide on one.  </p>

          Welcome my dedicated platform exploring the mysteries and wonders of asteroids, particularly those near our home planet. By harnessing the capabilities of NASA's NeoWs, the Near Earth Object Web Service, we aim to bring you accurate, timely, and fascinating information about these celestial wanderers. Thank you for visiting my website. I hope it sparks curiosity, provides clarity, and fosters a deeper appreciation for the vastness and intricacies of our universe.

        <h1>what are asteroids</h1>
        <p>Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun, like planets but much smaller in size. They are remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. In popular culture, asteroids are sometimes confused with meteoroids, meteors, and meteorites. When an asteroid enters Earth's atmosphere and burns up, it's called a meteor. If a fragment of that meteor reaches the Earth's surface, it's called a meteorite. Overall, asteroids are intriguing celestial bodies that offer clues about the early solar system and the formation of planets. They're also important to monitor for planetary defence reasons.</p>
